Formspree setup instructions for HOT Pflegedienst

1) Install client dependency (locally):
   npm install @formspree/react

2) The site uses the Formspree form ID: xpwovvzo
   - Ensure this form exists in your Formspree dashboard.

3) Configure email routing in Formspree dashboard:
   - Open https://formspree.io and log in.
   - Go to the form with ID `xpwovvzo`.
   - Under "Notifications" or "Email" settings, set the recipient to: info@hotpflegedienst.de
   - Verify the recipient (Formspree will send a verification email).

4) Optional: enable Webhooks for server-side processing or to store submissions elsewhere.

5) Test the form from the live site after deploying. The site component will show a success message when the mail is sent.

Notes:
- The client-side code cannot force Formspree to send to an email address; the recipient must be set in your Formspree account settings.
- If you need messages to come from a specific sender or include custom headers, configure Formspree advanced settings or add a server-side handler.
